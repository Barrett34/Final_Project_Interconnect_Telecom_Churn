# Final_Project_Interconnect_Telecom_Churn

In this project, we are provided with a dataset from a company named Interconnect Telecom. The company wants to understand why the customers churned or stopped their service. We will utilize machine learning to identify features of the data that has high predictive power when determining which customers will churn.

## Data Description
`contract.csv` — contract information
`personal.csv` — the client's personal data
`internet.csv` — information about Internet services
`phone.csv` — information about telephone services

## Conclusion
From our results, we see that the model with the highest ROC-AUC score is the Gradient Boosting model with Cross Validaiton with a score of .88. The highest model without any boosting was the Random Forest model with a ROC-AUC score of .83. The most accurate model  was the Gradient Boost model with a accuracy score of .84, the second highest was the Logistic Regression model, .80.
